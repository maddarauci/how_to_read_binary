binary is a base 2 numeric system: 
1:below is a 8 digit binary number

2: we calculate binary from right to left <br>
	```01011001``` <br>
3:because it is a base 2 system, each digit is 2 to the power of (n), 
    which refers to the placement of the number 
<br>
4: a binary number is pretty much telling us whether or not we are using that value.

```
	  0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
beComes: 2^7|2^6|2^5|2^4|2^3|2^2|2^1| 2^0
	 0  |64 |0  |16 |8  |0  | 0 | 1
	 total= 89
as an equation:
01011001 = (0*2^7)+(1*2^6)+(0*2^5)+(1*2^4)+(1*2^3)+(0*2^2)+(0*2^1)+(1*2^0)
 = 89
another: 
01101111

0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1

0 | 64| 32| 0 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1
total = 111
